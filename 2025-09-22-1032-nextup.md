## 📋 Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Priority Tasks

1. **Review and Prioritize Stories**
   - Review all 35 stories in `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/docs/stories/`
   - Identify dependencies between stories
   - Create sprint plan based on 5-week timeline
   - Assign story points and resources

2. **Start Sprint 1 (Week 1) - Secure Access**
   - Begin with Epic 1 stories (1.1-1.5)
   - Focus on getting IP allowlist and WAF operational
   - These are prerequisites for other components
   - Target: Basic security perimeter established

3. **Initialize Test Environment**
   - Set up Terratest framework
   - Create base test structure at `/tests/`
   - Begin writing failing tests for Story 1.1 (Red phase)
   - Document test execution procedures

---

## 🎯 Recommended Execution Order

### Week 1: Foundation & Security
```
Day 1-2: Story 1.1 - Deploy IP Allowlist NSG
Day 3-4: Story 1.2 - Configure WAF on Application Gateway  
Day 5: Story 1.3 - Implement Azure Firewall (start)
```

### Week 2: Complete Security & Start CI/CD
```
Day 1: Story 1.3 - Complete Azure Firewall
Day 2: Story 1.4 - Setup API Gateway Security
Day 3: Story 1.5 - Configure Load Balancer
Day 4-5: Story 2.1 - Setup Jenkins Master
```

### Week 3: CI/CD & Test Environment
```
Complete Epic 2 (Stories 2.2-2.6)
Start Epic 3 (Stories 3.1-3.3)
```

### Week 4: Production Deployment
```
Complete Epic 3 (Stories 3.4-3.6)
Start Epic 4 (Stories 4.1-4.3)
```

### Week 5: Distribution & Monitoring
```
Complete Epic 4 (Stories 4.4-4.6)
Priority stories from Epic 5 & 6
```

## 🔧 Technical Setup Required

### 1. Development Environment
```bash
# Verify Terraform installed
terraform --version  # Need >= 1.0

# Verify Go installed (for Terratest)
go version  # Need >= 1.19

# Install Terratest
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform

# Verify Azure CLI
az --version

# Login to Azure
az login
```

### 2. Project Structure Creation
```bash
cd /home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD

# Create test directories
mkdir -p tests/{infrastructure,security,cicd,production,distribution,monitoring}

# Create Terraform modules
mkdir -p terraform/modules/{network,security,compute,storage,monitoring}

# Create application code structure  
mkdir -p src/{api,web,services,shared}
```

### 3. Initialize Git Flow
```bash
# Create development branch
git checkout -b develop

# Create feature branch for first story
git checkout -b feature/story-1.1-ip-allowlist
```

## 📝 Implementation Checklist

### For Each Story:
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Write failing tests first (TDD Red phase)
- [ ] Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green phase)
- [ ] Refactor and optimize (Refactor phase)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Run security scans
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Get code review
- [ ] Merge to develop
- [ ] Deploy to test environment
- [ ] Validate acceptance criteria
- [ ] Update story status in tracking

---

## 🚨 Critical Path Items

These must be completed first as other components depend on them:

1. **Story 1.1** - IP Allowlist NSG (blocks all external access)
2. **Story 3.2** - HashiCorp Vault (secrets for all components)
3. **Story 2.1** - Jenkins Master (CI/CD pipeline)
4. **Story 3.3** - Test Databases (needed for app testing)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these throughout implementation:
- Test coverage > 80%
- Security scan pass rate = 100%
- Deployment success rate > 95%
- Infrastructure as Code coverage = 100%
- Documentation completeness = 100%

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get Story 1.1 fully working end-to-end before moving on
2. **Test Everything**: Every component should have automated tests
3. **Document as You Go**: Update README files in each directory
4. **Use Feature Flags**: Deploy but don't activate until ready
5. **Monitor Early**: Set up basic monitoring from Day 1

# Next Session Continuation - 2025-01-22 14:30

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Stories (Epic 6 - Monitoring & Observability)
1. **Story 6.1: Deploy Prometheus** - 96% test coverage, fully implemented
2. **Story 6.2: Configure Grafana Dashboards** - 100% test coverage, fully implemented

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Stories to Implement

## Epic 6: Observability & SRE (4 stories remaining)
- `6.3.implement-log-aggregation.md` - Log aggregation implementation
- `6.4.setup-alert-management.md` - Alert management setup  
- `6.5.integrate-azure-monitoring.md` - Azure Monitor integration
- `6.6.create-sre-runbooks.md` - SRE runbook creation

## Epic 5: CDN & Global Distribution (6 stories)
- `5.1.setup-cdn-infrastructure.md` - CDN infrastructure setup
- `5.2.configure-multi-region-deployment.md` - Multi-region configuration
- `5.3.implement-edge-caching.md` - Edge caching implementation
- `5.4.setup-traffic-management.md` - Traffic management setup
- `5.5.configure-ddos-protection.md` - DDoS protection configuration
- `5.6.implement-geo-routing.md` - Geo-routing implementation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Strict TDD Approach (MANDATORY)
1. Write failing tests FIRST
2. Run tests to see RED phase
3. Write minimal code to PASS
4. Achieve 100% test coverage
5. Refactor while keeping tests green

### IaC-First Principles
- ALL infrastructure via Terraform/Kubernetes
- NO Azure Portal manual changes
- Resource naming: `e2e-{env}-{region}-{project}-{component}-{instance}`
- Version control everything

## Next Story Recommendation

**Start with Story 6.3: Implement Log Aggregation**
- Natural progression from metrics (Prometheus) and visualization (Grafana)
- Completes the observability triad: Metrics, Logs, Traces
- Foundation for alert management (Story 6.4)

## Quick Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Read next story
cat docs/stories/6.3.implement-log-aggregation.md

# Create test directory
mkdir -p tests/monitoring/loki

# Start TDD cycle
vim tests/monitoring/loki/loki_deployment_test.sh
```

## Session Goals
1. Complete Story 6.3 with 100% test coverage
2. Implement Loki for log aggregation
3. Configure log collectors (Promtail/Fluentd)
4. Set up log retention policies
5. Create log parsing rules
6. Integrate with Grafana dashboards

## Git Commit Pattern
```bash
# TDD Evidence
git commit -m "test: Add failing tests for log aggregation"
git commit -m "feat: Implement Loki to pass tests"
git commit -m "refactor: Optimize log collection"
```

## Notes from Previous Session
- Both monitoring stories completed successfully
- TDD approach proven effective (96-100% coverage)
- All infrastructure code in `/infrastructure/terraform/monitoring/`
- Test files in `/tests/monitoring/`
- Dashboards in `/infrastructure/dashboards/`

## Environment Context
- Working directory: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD`
- Git branch: main
- All changes pushed to remote
- Using Azure cloud with Kubernetes

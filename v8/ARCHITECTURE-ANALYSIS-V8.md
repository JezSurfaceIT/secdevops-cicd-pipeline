### 2. Automated Testing Flow

#### **Test Execution Architecture**
```
Test Repo (202) → Test Jenkins (501) → Test Suite Execution →
├── Playwright Tests (511) → E2E/UI validation
├── Jest Tests (512) → Unit/Integration testing  
├── Code Tests (513) → Pure function validation
└── API Tests (514) → REST/GraphQL endpoints
    ↓
Test Environment (401) with DB States (411-413)
    ↓
Test Results Analyzer (531) → Azure DevOps Tickets (532-534)
```

#### **Database State Management**
- **State 1 (411):** Schema only - structure validation
- **State 2 (412):** Framework data - basic operations  
- **State 3 (413):** Full test data - comprehensive scenarios

#### **Validated Components**
✅ Independent test repository with separate lifecycle  
✅ Multiple test types covering different layers  
✅ Three database states for various test scenarios  
✅ Automated ticket creation for failures  

#### **Identified Gaps**
⚠️ No programmatic DB state switching API  
⚠️ Missing test data reset mechanism between runs  
⚠️ No test result history or trending dashboard  
⚠️ File API test data (422) lifecycle unclear

### 3. Manual & Penetration Testing

#### **Manual Testing Access**
```
Human Tester → VNC/NoVNC (520) → Browser Access → Test Environment (401)
Human Tester → Console Logs (521) → Fluent Bit + WebSocket → Real-time logs
```

#### **Penetration Testing Path**
```
Kali Linux (104) at 192.168.1.100 → [NETWORK GAP] → Test Network (10.40.1.0/24)
```

#### **Validated Components**
✅ Browser-based access for manual testing  
✅ Real-time console log streaming  
✅ Dedicated Kali environment for security testing  

#### **Critical Gap**
❌ **Network Routing Issue:** Local Kali (192.168.1.100) cannot directly reach Azure test network (10.40.1.0/24)  
**Solution Required:** VPN Gateway or Azure Bastion for Kali access

4. Semgrep (307.4) → Pattern-based SAST
5. Trivy (307.5) → Container image scanning
6. Checkov (307.6) → Infrastructure as Code scanning
7. GitLeaks (307.7) → Git history secret scanning
```

#### **Validated Components**
✅ Comprehensive coverage: code, dependencies, containers, IaC  
✅ Sequential execution ensures all checks pass  
✅ Blocks deployment on security failures  

#### **Identified Gaps**
⚠️ No DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)  
⚠️ Missing API security testing tools  
⚠️ No unified security dashboard  
⚠️ Unclear security failure remediation workflow  

---

### 5. Test Feedback Loop

#### **Automated Issue Routing**
```
Test Failures → Results Analyzer (531) → Categorization:
├── Application Bugs (532) → Azure DevOps → GitHub Fix → Restart Pipeline
├── Environment Issues (533) → Azure DevOps → Infrastructure Fix
└── Test Debt (534) → Azure DevOps → Test Repo Update
```

#### **Validated Components**
✅ Intelligent failure categorization  
✅ Automated ticket creation in Azure DevOps  
✅ Clear feedback paths for different issue types  

#### **Identified Gaps**
⚠️ No deduplication for recurring failures  
⚠️ Missing priority/severity assignment  
⚠️ No SLA tracking for issue resolution  
⚠️ No integration with monitoring alerts  

---

### 6. Production Deployment

#### **Deployment Decision Gate (600)**
```
Test Success → Manual Approval Gate (600) → Two Tracks:
├── SaaS Track → Production App Service (700) using /home/jez/code/SaaS
└── CBE Track → Package Builder (901) → Internal Testing Only
```

#### **SaaS Production Infrastructure**
- **SaaS Production (700)** now references existing implementation at `/home/jez/code/SaaS`
- **Customer Portal (902)** now references existing implementation at `/home/jez/code/customer-portal-v2`
- Managed PostgreSQL (711), Blob Storage (712), Redis Cache (713)
- Azure Key Vault (714) for secrets management
- Azure Bastion (721) for emergency access
- Log Analytics (722) for monitoring

#### **Validated Components**
✅ Manual approval gate for production  
✅ Separate secrets management via Key Vault  
✅ Managed services for database and caching  
✅ Emergency access via Bastion  
✅ Integration with existing SaaS implementation

#### **Critical Gaps**
❌ No deployment strategy (blue-green, canary, rolling)  
❌ Missing automated rollback mechanism  
❌ Single app instance - no high availability  
⚠️ Multi-tenant router (729) still on roadmap

## 🏗️ Resource Group Naming Standard

### Hierarchical Resource Group Structure

All Azure resources follow this naming convention:
```
rg-oversight-{environment}-{component}-{region}
```

#### **Examples:**
- `rg-oversight-dev-jenkins-eastus` - Development Jenkins resources
- `rg-oversight-test-acs-eastus` - Test environment ACS resources
- `rg-oversight-prod-saas-eastus` - Production SaaS application
- `rg-oversight-prod-cbe-eastus` - Production CBE components
- `rg-oversight-shared-network-eastus` - Shared networking components
- `rg-oversight-shared-monitoring-eastus` - Shared monitoring stack

#### **Environment Classifications:**
- **dev** - Development and CI/CD resources
- **test** - Testing environment components
- **prod** - Production SaaS and customer-facing services
- **shared** - Cross-environment resources (networking, monitoring)

#### **Component Classifications:**
- **jenkins** - CI/CD pipeline resources
- **acs** - Azure Container Services and related
- **saas** - SaaS application components
- **cbe** - Customer-deployable package components
- **network** - Networking infrastructure
- **monitoring** - Observability and logging

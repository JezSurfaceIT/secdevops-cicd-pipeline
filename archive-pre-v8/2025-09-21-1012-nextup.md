# Next Session Continuation - 2025-09-21 10:12

## Current Status
Successfully completed E2E CI/CD pipeline validation with autonomous deployment script.

## Completed Today:
1. ✅ Started monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
2. ✅ Started Jenkins CI/CD server
3. ✅ Created dummy test application with full test coverage
4. ✅ Built autonomous E2E pipeline script (`run-e2e-pipeline.sh`)
5. ✅ Successfully tested pipeline - deployed v1.1 to Azure Container Instance
6. ✅ Secured deployments by removing public containers
7. ✅ Created Application Gateway deployment script for IP restrictions

## Script Created:
**Location:** `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/run-e2e-pipeline.sh`
- Fully autonomous CI/CD pipeline
- Runs from code to Azure deployment in ~100 seconds
- Includes security scanning, quality gates, and verification
- No manual intervention required

## Next Steps:
1. Execute the Application Gateway deployment script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/deploy-with-app-gateway.sh
   ./deploy-with-app-gateway.sh 86.3.129.121
   ```
   Note: This will take 15-20 minutes to create the Application Gateway

2. Integrate the autonomous pipeline with Jenkins

3. Add more sophisticated security scanning:
   - OWASP ZAP for DAST
   - SonarQube integration
   - Anchore for compliance

4. Implement blue-green deployment strategy

5. Add performance testing stage

## Services Running:
- Jenkins: http://localhost:8080 (initial password: 27eaee2a61aa4a5e97e04df34411b49f)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9091
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093

## Key Achievements:
- Proved E2E pipeline works autonomously
- Security scanning integrated
- Quality gates enforced
- Deployment to Azure successful
- Monitoring stack operational

## Repository Locations:
- Main project: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/`
- Dummy app: `/home/jez/code/dummy-app-e2e-test/`
- Monitoring configs: `/tmp/monitoring/`

## Azure Resources:
- Resource Group: `rg-secdevops-cicd-dev`
- Container Registry: `acrsecdevopsdev.azurecr.io`
- Images pushed: `dummy-app-e2e-test:v1.0` and `v1.1`

Ready to continue with Application Gateway deployment or any other tasks in the next session.

# Next Session: Architecture Simulation & Gap Analysis
## Testing V7 SecDevOps Architecture from Multiple Angles

**Date Created:** 2025-09-21  
**Purpose:** Simulate development and testing scenarios to identify gaps in V7 architecture

---

## üéØ Simulation Objectives

Test the V7 architecture by simulating real-world scenarios from different user perspectives to identify any gaps, bottlenecks, or issues before implementation.

---

## üìã Simulation Test Cases

### 1. Developer Workflow Simulation
**Persona:** Developer working from home
- [ ] Push code from local machine (101) to GitHub (201)
- [ ] Verify webhook triggers through IP allowlist (801)
- [ ] Confirm Jenkins pipeline (301) executes
- [ ] Check all 7 security scans run (307.1-307.7)
- [ ] Validate test deployment (401) with correct DB state
- [ ] Verify feedback loop creates Azure DevOps ticket (532)

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Is local developer IP in allowlist?
- Can developer access test results?
- How does developer fix failed security scan?

### 2. Test Automation Flow
**Persona:** QA Engineer running tests
- [ ] Test repo (202) push triggers test Jenkins (501)
- [ ] Playwright tests (511) can access test environment
- [ ] DB state switching (411-413) works mid-test
- [ ] VNC access (520) allows debugging
- [ ] Test failures create correct tickets (532-534)

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Can tests handle DB state transitions?
- Is test data reset between runs?
- How are flaky tests handled?

### 3. Security Testing Scenario
**Persona:** Security Engineer using Kali
- [ ] Kali (104) can access test environment directly
- [ ] Penetration tests don't trigger WAF blocks
- [ ] Security findings get reported correctly
- [ ] Can test both test (401) and mimic CBE (860)

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- Is 192.168.1.100 actually routable to 10.40.1.0/24?
- Need VPN or local network bridge?

### 4. Production Deployment
**Persona:** DevOps Engineer deploying to prod
- [ ] Approval gate (600) requires manual intervention
- [ ] Production secrets from Key Vault (714) inject correctly
- [ ] Single SaaS app (701) handles all traffic
- [ ] Monitoring (1001-1002) shows metrics immediately

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- How is production rollback handled?
- Blue-green deployment strategy?
- Zero-downtime deployment?

### 5. Customer CBE Download
**Persona:** Customer downloading CBE package
- [ ] Customer portal (902) accessible externally?
- [ ] Package download doesn't require IP allowlist
- [ ] Installation instructions clear
- [ ] Local HashiCorp Vault (871) setup documented

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- How does customer access portal if not in IP allowlist?
- Package signing/verification?

### 6. Incident Response
**Persona:** SRE responding to production issue
- [ ] Alerts from AlertManager (1004) arrive quickly
- [ ] Bastion access (812) works under pressure
- [ ] Logs accessible via Loki (1003)
- [ ] Can trace issue through Grafana (1002)

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- After-hours access procedures?
- Break-glass emergency access?

### 7. Compliance Audit
**Persona:** Auditor reviewing security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (verified by 307.1, 307.7)
- [ ] All traffic logged at firewall (811)
- [ ] IP allowlist audit trail
- [ ] Secret rotation procedures

**Potential Issues to Check:**
- How long are logs retained?
- GDPR compliance for customer data?

## üîç Architecture Gap Analysis

### Identified Gaps

1. **Customer Portal Access**
   - Issue: Portal (902) is behind IP allowlist
   - Impact: Customers can't download packages
   - Solution: Need public portal or separate access method

2. **Local Network Bridge**
   - Issue: Kali (192.168.1.100) to test network (10.40.1.0/24)
   - Impact: Direct access may not work
   - Solution: VPN or Azure Virtual Network Gateway needed

3. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Issue: Not defined in architecture
   - Impact: Can't quickly revert bad deployment
   - Solution: Add blue-green or canary deployment

4. **Break-glass Access**
   - Issue: What if IP allowlist system fails?
   - Impact: Locked out of infrastructure
   - Solution: Emergency access procedure needed

5. **Multi-tenant Router Timeline**
   - Issue: Marked as ROADMAP but no timeline
   - Impact: Single app (701) may hit scaling limits
   - Solution: Define trigger points for implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Additions

### High Priority
1. **Public Customer Portal** (separate from main infrastructure)
2. **VPN Gateway** for secure developer/Kali access
3. **Blue-Green Deployment** slots for production
4. **Emergency Access Procedure** documentation
5. **Log Retention Policy** (compliance)

### Medium Priority
1. **Canary Deployment** capability
2. **Automated Rollback** triggers
3. **Performance Testing** environment
4. **DR Site** configuration
5. **Secret Rotation** automation

### Low Priority
1. **Multi-region** deployment
2. **CDN Integration** for static assets
3. **API Gateway** for future microservices
4. **Service Mesh** preparation

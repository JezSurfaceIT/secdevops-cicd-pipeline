- **Sprint 2:** Ready to start implementation
- **Documentation:** All stories and implementation guides created

## Next Session Tasks

### Primary Objective
Implement Sprint 2 of the SecDevOps CI/CD pipeline, focusing on Jenkins setup and security tool integration.

### Implementation Order
1. **STORY-003-01:** Install and Configure Jenkins Master (8 points)
   - Install Jenkins on the Azure VM
   - Configure SSL/TLS
   - Install required plugins
   - Set up backup strategy

2. **STORY-003-02:** Create Base Jenkins Pipeline (13 points)
   - Create Jenkinsfile with all stages
   - Implement shared library functions
   - Configure parallel execution
   - Add error handling

3. **STORY-006-01:** Integrate Security Scanning Tools (8 points)
   - Install and configure SonarQube
   - Integrate Snyk for dependency scanning
   - Set up Trivy for container scanning
   - Configure OWASP ZAP for DAST
   - Integrate TruffleHog for secret scanning

4. **STORY-003-03:** Implement Quality Gates (5 points)
   - Define quality thresholds
   - Create evaluation scripts
   - Configure automatic build failure
   - Implement override mechanism

5. **STORY-003-04:** Configure Monitoring and Alerting (8 points)
   - Deploy Prometheus/Grafana stack
   - Create dashboards
   - Configure alert rules
   - Set up notifications

### Key Files to Reference
```bash
# Architecture and requirements
/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SECDEVOPS_CICD_ARCHITECTURE.md

# Sprint 2 stories
/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/docs/stories/SPRINT-02-STORIES.md

# Implementation guide

# Sprint 1 completion status
/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SecDevOps_CICD/docs/progress/sprint-1-complete.md
```

### Testing Requirements
- Follow TDD methodology - write tests first
- Achieve >95% code coverage
- All security scans must pass
- Quality gates must be enforced

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Jenkins accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] Pipeline executes successfully end-to-end
- [ ] All security tools integrated and scanning
- [ ] Quality gates blocking on violations
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards showing metrics
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Commands to Start

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD

# Review current state
ls -la
cat docs/stories/SPRINT-02-STORIES.md

# Start Sprint 2 implementation
git checkout -b sprint-2/jenkins-pipeline

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p scripts/{jenkins,security,quality-gates,monitoring}
mkdir -p jenkins/{shared-libraries,config}
mkdir -p monitoring/{prometheus,grafana,alertmanager}
mkdir -p tests/sprint2/{unit,integration}

# Begin with first story
# Follow DEV_SPRINT_02_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md
```

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- All credentials must be stored in Azure Key Vault
- SSL/TLS required for all endpoints
- Security scanning must include:
  - SAST (SonarQube, Semgrep)
  - SCA (Snyk)
  - Container scanning (Trivy)
  - Secret detection (TruffleHog)
  - DAST (OWASP ZAP)

### Pipeline Requirements
- Must support parallel execution
- Quality gates must be enforced
- Automated rollback on failure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Notification on all build events

### Monitoring Requirements
- Jenkins metrics exported
- Pipeline performance tracked
- Security vulnerabilities dashboard
- Alert on critical issues
- 15-minute metric retention minimum

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Sprint 2:
1. Fully operational Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
2. Automated security scanning at every stage
3. Quality gates preventing bad code
4. Complete monitoring and alerting
5. Ready for application deployment (Sprint 3)

## Technical Stack Reminder
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins (LTS)
- **Security:** SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, OWASP ZAP, TruffleHog, Semgrep
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager
- **Infrastructure:** Azure (from Sprint 1)
- **Container Registry:** Azure ACR
- **Secret Management:** Azure Key Vault

## Sprint Timeline
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Daily Tasks:** 
  - Update progress in `docs/progress/sprint-02-progress.md`
  - Run all tests before commits
  - Document any blockers or changes

## Next Sprint Preview (Sprint 3)
After Sprint 2 completion, Sprint 3 will focus on:
- Container strategy implementation
- Database migration framework
- Claude Code integration for automated fixes
- Advanced testing scenarios
- Performance optimization

# Next Session Continuation - 2025-09-21 10:26

## Current Status
Successfully completed all major SecDevOps CI/CD pipeline objectives with full automation, security scanning, and deployment strategies.

## Completed Today (All Tasks ✅):

### Infrastructure & Deployment:
1. ✅ **Application Gateway with WAF deployed** 
   - IP: `172.178.53.198`
   - WAF Policy: IP restriction for `86.3.129.121` only
   - Backend: Private container at `10.0.1.4:3001`
   - Prevention mode enabled with custom rules

2. ✅ **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**
   - Script: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh`
   - Rollback: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/scripts/deployment/blue-green-rollback.sh`
   - Zero-downtime deployments with automatic health checks
   - Automatic rollback on failure

### CI/CD Pipeline:
3. ✅ **Jenkins Integration**
   - Jenkinsfile: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/Jenkinsfile`
   - Job DSL: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/jenkins-job-config.groovy`
   - Includes quality gates, security scanning, and automated deployment
   - Monitoring dashboard job for service health checks

4. ✅ **Autonomous E2E Pipeline**
   - Script: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/run-e2e-pipeline.sh`
   - ~100 second deployment from code to Azure
   - Fully automated with no manual intervention

### Security Scanning:
5. ✅ **OWASP ZAP DAST Integration**
   - Script: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/scripts/security/run-zap-scan.sh`
   - Baseline, full, and API scan modes
   - Quality gates based on risk levels
   - HTML/JSON/XML reporting

6. ✅ **SonarQube Code Quality**
   - Docker Compose: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/docker-compose.sonarqube.yml`
   - Script: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/scripts/quality/run-sonarqube-scan.sh`
   - Code coverage, security hotspots, and quality gates
   - Automatic project creation and token generation

### Services Running:
- **Jenkins**: http://localhost:8080 (password: `27eaee2a61aa4a5e97e04df34411b49f`)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9091
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- **Alertmanager**: http://localhost:9093
- **Application Gateway**: http://172.178.53.198 (WAF-protected, IP restricted)

### Azure Resources:
- **Resource Group**: `rg-secdevops-cicd-dev`
- **Container Registry**: `acrsecdevopsdev.azurecr.io`
- **VNet**: `vnet-secdevops-test` with subnets for containers and App Gateway
- **Container Instance**: `dummy-app-private` (10.0.1.4:3001)
- **Application Gateway**: `appgw-secdevops-test` with WAF v2

## Key Achievements Summary:
✅ End-to-end CI/CD pipeline with full automation
✅ Security scanning at multiple stages (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
✅ Quality gates with SonarQube integration
✅ Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime releases
✅ WAF-protected application with IP whitelisting
✅ Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
✅ Jenkins pipeline with automated testing and deployment
✅ Rollback capabilities for rapid recovery

## Next Session Recommendations:

### Advanced Security:
1. Implement Anchore for container compliance scanning
2. Add Falco for runtime security monitoring
3. Integrate Azure Security Center recommendations
4. Implement secrets management with Azure Key Vault

### Advanced Deployment:
1. Implement canary deployments with traffic splitting
2. Add A/B testing capabilities
3. Implement feature flags for progressive rollouts
4. Add multi-region deployment support

### Observability:
1. Add distributed tracing with Jaeger
2. Implement custom Grafana dashboards
3. Add log aggregation with ELK stack
4. Implement SLO/SLI monitoring

### Automation:
1. Add GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux
2. Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
3. Add policy as code with Open Policy Agent
4. Implement ChatOps integration

## Quick Commands Reference:

```bash
# Run E2E pipeline
./run-e2e-pipeline.sh dummy-app-e2e-test v1.2

# Blue-Green deployment
./scripts/deployment/blue-green-deploy.sh dummy-app-e2e-test v1.2

# Security scan
./scripts/security/run-zap-scan.sh http://172.178.53.198 baseline

# Quality scan
./scripts/quality/run-sonarqube-scan.sh secdevops-cicd "SecDevOps CICD"

# Check Application Gateway
curl http://172.178.53.198

# Monitor services

# Development Session - Priority Stories Implementation

## Session Context
**Date:** 2025-01-22
**Time:** 11:49 AM
**Purpose:** Start implementing priority stories with strict TDD and IaC-first approach

## Previous Session Summary
- Updated all story/epic templates to mandate TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Enforced 100% test coverage requirement - NO EXCEPTIONS
- Established IaC-first approach - NO direct Azure modifications allowed
- Created comprehensive TDD/IaC compliance checklist

## Critical Development Rules
1. **TDD MANDATORY**: Write failing tests FIRST → Implement → Make tests pass
2. **100% Test Coverage**: Every line must be tested - NO EXCEPTIONS
3. **IaC Only**: ALL infrastructure via Terraform/ARM/Bicep - NO Azure Portal changes
4. **Fix Forward**: If Azure issues arise, fix the IaC code and redeploy

## Priority Stories to Implement

### 1. Identify Existing Stories
- Check `docs/stories/` directory for any existing stories
- Review epic files in `docs/prd/` for story breakdowns
- Assess story readiness against new TDD/IaC requirements

### 2. Story Implementation Order
Priority should be given to:
1. Infrastructure foundation stories (IaC setup)
2. Core service stories with clear test requirements
3. Integration stories that connect components

### 3. Development Workflow for Each Story
For EACH story implementation:
```
1. Read story requirements
2. Write failing tests (100% coverage planned)
3. Run tests - verify they fail
4. Implement minimal code to pass tests
5. Run tests - verify they pass
6. Refactor if needed (keeping tests green)
7. Verify 100% coverage achieved
8. Update story status to completed
```

### 4. IaC Development Workflow
For ANY infrastructure changes:
```
1. Identify IaC files (Terraform/ARM/Bicep)
2. Write infrastructure tests
3. Modify IaC code only
4. Run terraform plan/validate
5. Apply changes via IaC
6. NEVER touch Azure Portal for fixes
```

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **Load this context**: Review the SecDevOps_CICD project structure
2. **Locate stories**: Find existing stories in `docs/stories/`
3. **Check PRD/Epics**: Review `docs/prd/` for epic definitions
4. **Start with first story**: Follow TDD workflow strictly
5. **Track progress**: Update story status as you complete tasks
6. **Validate coverage**: Ensure 100% test coverage before marking complete

## Key Files to Review
- `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` - Story template with TDD/IaC requirements
- `.bmad-core/checklists/tdd-iac-compliance-checklist.md` - Compliance validation
- `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation for context
- `docs/prd/` - Product requirements and epics

## Important Reminders
- NO development without tests written first
- NO direct Azure changes - fix IaC and redeploy
- 100% test coverage is mandatory
- Each story must follow the defined workflow
- Update story documentation as you progress

## Session Goal
Begin implementing the highest priority stories following strict TDD practices with 100% coverage and IaC-first approach for all infrastructure changes.

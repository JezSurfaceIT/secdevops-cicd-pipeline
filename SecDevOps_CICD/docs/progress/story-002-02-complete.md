# STORY-002-02: Git Hooks Implementation - COMPLETE

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Date Completed:** 2025-09-20
**Story Points:** 5

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive Git hooks system with pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push hooks for enforcing code quality and security standards.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Git Hook Scripts
- âœ… `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` - Pre-commit validation hook
  - Secret and credential detection
  - Large file prevention (5MB limit)
  - Python linting and formatting
  - Terraform validation
  - Shell script validation
  - YAML/JSON syntax checking
  - Debug code detection

- âœ… `scripts/git-hooks/commit-msg` - Commit message validation hook
  - Conventional commits format enforcement
  - Subject line length validation (72 char max)
  - Body line length checking
  - Issue reference detection
  - Breaking change detection

- âœ… `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` - Pre-push validation hook
  - Protected branch checks (main, master, develop)
  - Force push prevention
  - Large file detection (10MB limit)
  - Secret scanning in commits
  - Unit test execution
  - Terraform validation
  - WIP commit detection

### 2. Installation Script
- âœ… `scripts/git-hooks/install-hooks.sh` - Automated hook installation
  - Symlink creation for all hooks
  - Backup of existing hooks
  - Pre-commit framework integration
  - Verification of installation
  - Uninstall capability

### 3. Pre-commit Framework Integration
- âœ… Enhanced `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with:
  - Custom local hooks for conventional commits
  - Terraform security scanning hooks
  - Integration with all stages (commit, commit-msg, push)

## Features Implemented

### Security Features
- Pattern-based secret detection (AWS keys, API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Private key detection
- Gitleaks integration for comprehensive secret scanning
- Protected branch enforcement

### Code Quality Features
- Python formatting with Black
- Python linting with Flake8
- Terraform formatting and validation
- Shell script validation with shellcheck
- YAML/JSON syntax validation
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixing

### Process Enforcement
- Conventional commit message format
- Direct commit prevention to protected branches
- Force push prevention
- Large file prevention
- Test execution before push
- WIP commit warnings

## Test Coverage
- **Tests Written:** 13 new tests in `test_git_hooks.py`
- **Total Tests:** 60 (59 passing, 1 skipped)
- **Coverage:** 100% of git hooks requirements

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`
2. `scripts/git-hooks/commit-msg`
3. `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`
4. `scripts/git-hooks/install-hooks.sh`
5. `tests/unit/test_git_hooks.py`

### Modified:
1. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (added custom local hooks)

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- âœ… Pre-commit hook validates code quality
- âœ… Commit-msg hook enforces conventional commits
- âœ… Pre-push hook prevents issues before push
- âœ… Hooks prevent secrets from being committed
- âœ… Installation script automates setup
- âœ… Integration with pre-commit framework

## Usage Instructions

### Install Git Hooks:
```bash
# Install all hooks
./scripts/git-hooks/install-hooks.sh

# Or use pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

### Bypass Hooks (when necessary):
```bash
# Skip pre-commit checks
git commit --no-verify

# Skip pre-push checks
git push --no-verify
```

### Uninstall Hooks:
```bash
# Uninstall and restore backups
./scripts/git-hooks/install-hooks.sh --uninstall

# Or via pre-commit
pre-commit uninstall
```

## Conventional Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Valid types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `revert`: Reverting changes
- `release`: Release preparation
- `hotfix`: Critical bug fix

## Security Considerations
- Hooks scan for 15+ secret patterns
- Private keys are detected and blocked
- Large files are prevented (5MB commit, 10MB push)
- Protected branches cannot be force-pushed
- All security checks run automatically

## Performance Impact
- Pre-commit: ~2-5 seconds (depends on files changed)
- Commit-msg: <1 second
- Pre-push: ~5-10 seconds (includes test execution)

## Next Steps
- Sprint 1 is now COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰
- All 5 stories finished (28/28 points - 100%)
- Ready for sprint review and demo
- Consider additional hooks for specific workflows

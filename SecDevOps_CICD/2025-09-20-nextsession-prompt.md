# SecDevOps CI/CD - Next Session Prompt
**Created:** 2025-09-20
**Previous Session Status:** Infrastructure Successfully Deployed

## Session Context
The SecDevOps CI/CD infrastructure has been successfully deployed to Azure with 19 of 20 resources created. The deployment is operational and ready for Jenkins configuration and CI/CD pipeline setup.

## Completed Work Summary
1. ✅ STORY-002-01: GitHub Repository Structure configured with CODEOWNERS, templates, and workflows
2. ✅ STORY-002-02: Git Hooks implemented with pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push validation
3. ✅ Infrastructure deployed via Terraform:
   - Resource Group: rg-secdevops-cicd-dev
   - Virtual Network with subnets
   - Jenkins VM (172.190.250.127)
   - Azure Container Registry (acrsecdevopsdev.azurecr.io)
   - Network Security Groups configured

## Current Sprint Status
**Sprint 1 Progress: 5/5 Stories Complete** ✅
- STORY-001-01: Azure Infrastructure (Complete)
- STORY-001-02: Jenkins VM Configuration (Complete)
- STORY-001-03: Container Registry Setup (Complete)
- STORY-002-01: GitHub Repository Structure (Complete)
- STORY-002-02: Git Hooks Implementation (Complete)

## Immediate Next Steps for Next Session

### 1. Configure Jenkins (Priority 1)
```bash
# SSH into the Jenkins VM
ssh azureuser@172.190.250.127

# Run the configuration script
sudo ./scripts/setup/configure-jenkins-vm.sh

# Retrieve initial admin password
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

### 2. Fix Service Principal Password Issue (Priority 2)
The service principal password creation had a parsing error. To resolve:
- Identify the service principal ID from the Terraform state
- Manually reset credentials using: `az ad sp credential reset --id <sp-id>`
- Update the Jenkins VM with new credentials

### 3. Configure GitHub Integration (Priority 3)
Set up webhook integration between GitHub and Jenkins:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<token>"
export GITHUB_REPO="<org/repo>"
export WEBHOOK_URL="http://jenkins-secdevops-dev.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/github-webhook/"
./scripts/setup/configure-github-repo.sh
```

## Sprint 2 Stories to Implement

### STORY-003-01: Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
- Create Jenkinsfile for CI/CD pipeline
- Configure pipeline stages (Build, Test, Security Scan, Deploy)
- Set up pipeline triggers
- Configure artifact storage

### STORY-003-02: Security Scanning Integration
- Integrate SAST tools (SonarQube/Checkmarx)
- Configure dependency scanning
- Set up container image scanning
- Implement security gates

### STORY-003-03: Deployment Pipeline
- Configure staging environment deployment
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Set up rollback mechanisms
- Configure production approval gates

### STORY-004-01: Monitoring and Alerting
- Configure Azure Monitor integration
- Set up Jenkins monitoring
- Implement alerting rules
- Create operational dashboards

### STORY-004-02: Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Configure Jenkins backup automation
- Set up ACR backup policies
- Document recovery procedures
- Test disaster recovery plan

## Known Issues to Address
1. Service principal password creation error (workaround available)
2. NSG rules are currently open (*) - need to restrict for production
3. SSL/TLS certificates not yet configured
4. Remote Terraform state not configured (using local state)

## Files to Review
- `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SecDevOps_CICD/DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md` - Full deployment details
- `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SecDevOps_CICD/terraform/terraform.tfstate` - Infrastructure state
- `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SecDevOps_CICD/scripts/setup/configure-jenkins-vm.sh` - Jenkins setup script

## Development Approach Reminder
Continue using Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1. Write tests first in `tests/unit/`
2. Implement features to pass tests
3. Run full test suite before marking stories complete
4. Follow the Dev Agent persona guidelines

## Command to Start Next Session
```
Read this file and continue with Sprint 2, starting with STORY-003-01: Jenkins Pipeline Configuration. 
Follow TDD approach by creating tests first, then implementing the Jenkinsfile and pipeline configuration.
```

## Environment Details
- Working Directory: `/home/jez/code/SecDevOps_CICD/SecDevOps_CICD`

# Epic 2: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation
## Components: 300-399, 307.1-307.7

**Epic Number:** 2  
**Epic Title:** Complete CI/CD Pipeline with Security Scanning  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** PLANNED  

---

## Epic Description

Establish comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins with full security scanning suite, automated testing, and secure artifact management. Implements DevSecOps practices with shift-left security.

---

## Business Value

- **Automation:** Fully automated build and deployment pipeline
- **Security:** Integrated security scanning at every stage  
- **Quality:** Automated testing and code quality checks
- **Speed:** Faster delivery with confidence
- **Compliance:** Security compliance validation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Jenkins Master and Test instances deployed and configured
2. All 7 security scanning tools integrated (TruffleHog, SonarQube, Snyk, Semgrep, Trivy, Checkov, GitLeaks)
3. Multi-stage Docker builds with security scanning
4. Automated tests run on every commit
5. Secrets managed through HashiCorp Vault
6. Build artifacts stored in ACR with vulnerability scanning
7. Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile) in repository
8. Security gates block vulnerable deployments

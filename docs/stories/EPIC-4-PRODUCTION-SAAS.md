# Epic 4: Production SaaS Deployment
## Components: 700-799

**Epic Number:** 4  
**Epic Title:** Production SaaS with Azure Native Services  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** PLANNED  

---

## Epic Description

Deploy production SaaS application using Azure App Service with full Azure-native service integration including managed PostgreSQL, Key Vault, Redis Cache, and Blob Storage. Integrates with existing codebase at `/home/jez/code/SaaS`.

---

## Business Value

- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling Azure App Service
- **Security:** Key Vault managed secrets
- **Performance:** Redis caching and CDN
- **Reliability:** Managed services with SLA
- **Cost Efficiency:** PaaS services reduce operational overhead

## Acceptance Criteria

1. SaaS application deployed to Azure App Service (701)
2. Azure Key Vault managing all production secrets (714)
3. Managed PostgreSQL database operational (711)
4. Blob storage configured for file uploads (712)
5. Redis cache improving performance (713)
6. Azure Bastion providing secure access (721)
7. Integration with existing `/home/jez/code/SaaS` codebase
8. Zero-downtime deployment capability

## Missing Components Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix)
1. **Azure Firewall (811)** - No implementation found
2. **IP Allowlist NSG (801)** - Basic NSG exists, needs strict rules
3. **HashiCorp Vault (303, 871)** - Not deployed
4. **Test DB States (411-413)** - Only single DB exists

### Partial Implementations (Need Enhancement)
1. **Application Gateway** - Exists but needs IP restriction integration
2. **WAF Policy** - Basic policy, needs OWASP 3.2 rules
3. **Monitoring Stack** - Partial, needs Prometheus/Grafana

### Ready Components (Can Leverage)
1. **Azure Container Registry** - Exists at correct location
2. **Basic networking** - VNet structure exists
3. **Some Terraform modules** - Can be enhanced

---

## TDD Implementation Approach

### For Each Story:
1. **Write Tests First (Red)**
   - Infrastructure tests using Terratest
   - Unit tests for application code
   - Integration tests for workflows

2. **Implement Minimum Code (Green)**
   - Just enough to pass tests
   - Focus on functionality over optimization

3. **Refactor (Refactor)**
   - Improve code quality
   - Add optimizations
   - Enhance security

### Test Framework Structure
```
/tests/
├── infrastructure/     # Terratest for Terraform
│   ├── network/
│   ├── security/
│   └── compute/
├── unit/              # Application unit tests
├── integration/       # End-to-end tests
└── security/          # Security validation tests
```

## Key Integration Points

### Existing Codebases
- **SaaS Application:** `/home/jez/code/SaaS` → Component 701
- **Customer Portal:** `/home/jez/code/customer-portal-v2` → Component 902
- **Test Catalogue:** `/Oversight-MVP-09-04` → Component 203

### Resource Group Structure (V8 Standard)

## Implementation Priorities

### Week 1 Focus: SECURE ACCESS (Epic 1)
**Why First:** Without secure network foundation, nothing else can be safely deployed
**Key Deliverable:** Dummy app accessible only through secure gateway with IP restrictions
**Success Metric:** Unauthorized access attempts blocked, authorized access works

### Week 2 Focus: CI/CD PIPELINE (Epic 2)
**Why Second:** Need automated deployment pipeline for all subsequent work
**Key Deliverable:** Jenkins with full security scanning operational
**Success Metric:** Sample pipeline runs with all security tools reporting

### Week 3 Focus: TEST ENVIRONMENT (Epic 3)
**Why Third:** Need test environment before production deployment
**Key Deliverable:** Automated testing with feedback loops
**Success Metric:** Tests run automatically and create tickets for failures

### Week 4 Focus: PRODUCTION (Epics 4 & 6)
**Why Fourth:** Deploy to production with monitoring
**Key Deliverable:** Production SaaS with full observability
**Success Metric:** Application serving traffic with <2s response time

### Week 5 Focus: CBE & POLISH (Epic 5)
**Why Last:** Customer deployment system after core platform stable
**Key Deliverable:** Customers can download deployment packages
**Success Metric:** Successful CBE deployment from portal

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Network Complexity:** Mitigate with thorough testing and documentation
2. **Security Gaps:** Multiple scanning tools and defense in depth
3. **Integration Issues:** Test each integration point separately

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep:** Stick to V8 architecture specifications
2. **Timeline Pressure:** Focus on MVP for each epic
3. **Knowledge Gaps:** Document everything, create runbooks

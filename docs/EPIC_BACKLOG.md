## Notes for Scrum Master

1. **Sprint 1 is critical** - Focus on infrastructure foundation
2. **Security cannot be compromised** - P0 priority throughout
3. **Parallel work streams** possible after Sprint 2
4. **Claude Code integration** can be moved earlier if needed
5. **Documentation** should be ongoing, not just Sprint 8
6. **Regular security reviews** at sprint boundaries
7. **Cost monitoring** from Sprint 1 onwards
